					<p>After getting the low down on the new brewery opening up in Harrisburg, NC back in July we finally have an update! Pharr Mill had a preview night last weekend and we had the opportunity to go. </p>
					<span class="image featured"><img src="/images/breweries/pharrmill/menu.jpg" alt="behind-the-bar" /></span>
					<p>The menu was small, but diverse.  We opted for a flight to get the chance to taste everything.  The standout was surprisingly the sour.  It was well balanced and not too sharp for those new to sours.  The other beer selection included a pale ale,  a brown ale, and a gose to note a few.  The staff recommended the Gose, which we also found pleasant. </p>
					<span class="image featured"><img src="/images/breweries/pharrmill/flight.jpg" alt="behind-the-bar" /></span>
					<p>Overall the atmosphere at Pharr Mill was nice, but the beer selection was a bit lacking for our liking.  We enjoy things with a  bit more edge and hop, which was noticably lacking from their menu.  We talked to the staff and they noted that there are plans to have a nice IPA on tap for the grand opening. The grand opening is March 16, so keep an eye out!</p>
