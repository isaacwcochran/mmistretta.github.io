					<p>When Alston Richardson began home brewing in 2007, he was in undergrad at UNCC with his now business partner Kevin Bitner. After seeing the industry boom, having kids, and continuing to home brew, Richardson knew they should take the plunge and open a brewery of their own. After having their initial location in Matthews fall through, they decided to look closer to where they became friends near UNCC. This led to Harrisburg. </p>

					<p>The pair found a 1950s building in Harrisburg with exposed brick, wooden ceilings, and nice historic touches. They signed the lease and will move into the building this summer. The brewery has registered with the county and has gone through zoning, and are currently working through permits and licensing.</p>

					<p>Pharr Mill Brewing Co expects to focus on American Ales, while also maintaining variety. The taproom will have both indoor and outdoor spaces allowing it to be as pet friendly as possible. In addition, there are plans to have some small games, so that families can feel comfortable bringing their small children to the brewery to hang out. With Richardson having two sets of twins, being family friendly is a high priority. The taproom is expected to have views of the brewing equipment allowing drinkers to feel involved in the brewing process and ensure some nice taproom scenery.</p>
					<p>Look for Pharr Mill Brewing Co to open this fall.</p>
