					<p> We had heard about Idlewild through Instagram and man were we not disappointed when we made it in! This speakeasy style bar is everything you want for your cocktails, while allowing you to come in jeans and a t-shirt.  Due to North Carolina state laws they have to charge a membership fee.  But don't worry, it's only $1 and let's you bring in 3 friends as often as you like. They have only been open about a month and are killing it in the Charlotte market.</p>
					<span class="image featured"><img src="/images/cocktailbars/idlewild/idle-lounge.png" alt="behind-the-bar" /></span>
					<p>There is a nice bar with seating as well as some more lounge style areas with tables.  When we first arrived we sat at the bar and once a table opened up we were able to move to one of them. Both areas are comfortable.</p>

					<p>Idlewild sets itself apart by not having a cocktail menu.  Cocktail decisions are made by having a conversation with your server or bartender about what flavors and/or liquors you like. For example I enjoy gin and also something refreshing with citrus. The bartender made me Last Word (pictured left).  My husband went with Gin, but something more boozey and got a Rolls Royce (pictured right). All cocktails are $13, so there is no need to wonder how much you will end up paying at the end of the night</p>

					<p>We enjoyed our drinks so much that we opted to try some more fun cocktails and trusted the bartender and owner to make us something delicious.  My husband even got to try a whiskey drink featuring chocolate and orange flavors. We were never disappointed.</p>

					<p>Idlewild has a small food menu with sharable plates and snacks.  We opted for the avocado bruschetta and can honestly say it was the best bruschetta we have ever had.  It has such a nice balance of acid and creaminess from the avocado.</p>
					<p>Outside of cocktails Idlewild offers $2 PBR cans (12oz) among other beer as well as a small wine selection filled with interesting bottles like Gruner Veltliner and Grenache Cinsault Rose. They don't currently have any specials any nights of the week, but the space is available to rent out.</p>
