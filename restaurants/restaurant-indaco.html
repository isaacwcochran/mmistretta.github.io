					<p>During this most recent Queen's Feast we had the pleasure of dining at Indaco.  It's a new restaurant in South End and did not disappoint.  Walking in the vibe is very modern with sleek lines and interesting light fixtures.</p>
					<span class="image featured"><img src="/images/restaurants/indaco/seating.jpg"/></span>
					<span class="image featured"><img src="/images/restaurants/indaco/cocktail.jpg"/></span>
					<p>I opted for the Irre-zest-able cocktail since it had pink peppercorn (which should be in basically all cocktails).  It was very refreshing. The selection of wines by the glass was an average size, but with a nice variety with prices from $10+/glass.</p>
					<span class="image featured"><img src="/images/restaurants/indaco/wine-menu.jpg"/></span>
					<span class="image featured"><img src="/images/restaurants/indaco/buratta.jpg"/></span>
					<p>We started off the night with the burrata and a pizza. The burrata was textural in the best way. It had a butternut squash puree, apples, and puffed farro along with the crisps it was served with.  It definitely had the night off to a good start.</p>
					<span class="image featured"><img src="/images/restaurants/indaco/pizza.jpg"/></span>
					<p>For the pizza we went with the Proscuitto pizza and we were thrilled with our choice.  The ricotta with the fontina and lemon was a dream.  It was light yet savory.</p>
					<span class="image featured"><img src="/images/restaurants/indaco/squidink.jpg"/></span>
					<span class="image featured"><img src="/images/restaurants/indaco/risotto.jpg"/></span>
					<p>Next, was the main course.  We were with the risotto and squid ink orecchiette.  We enjoyed both, but I did leave wondering if we should have gone with some of the other dishes.  I am a massive squid ink fan and the orecchiette left something to be desired. The risotto similarly was delicious, but not a must order again.</p>
					<span class="image featured"><img src="/images/restaurants/indaco/pannacotta.jpg"/></span>
					<span class="image featured"><img src="/images/restaurants/indaco/donuts.jpg"/></span>
					<p>We ended the night with panna cotta and the salted caramel bombolini.  Get the bombolini and it will not disappoint! The salted caramel was amazing and I wanted to lick the little cup it came in. </p>
					<p>Over, we will definitely return to Indaco. It doesn't replace our favorite Italian place in Charlotte, but it provides a more modern vibe I haven't seen many other Italian places hit.  We left overly full, which was great to see for restaurant week. Next time we would opt for no more than 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert. I am excited to see how Indaco evolved and does over time. </p>
