					<p>Walking into Poplar we knew it was small plates, but not much else.  The patio is front and center and very inviting. However, it was a bit chilly the night we went, so we opted to sit inside.  We quickly found out Poplar is a peruvian restaurant with dishes like ceviche and beef skewers.  Bruno Macchiavello is their chef and also happens to be the founder of beloved quick spot Viva Chicken.  Poplar is only open for dinner and well worth the visit. They offer a full bar in addition to the lovely wine we drank.</p>

					<p>We opted to start with the ceviche de camarones, higos y prosciutto, and a bottle of dry sparkling rose. We then added on some of the steak kabobs.  All 3 were delicious, but the meat specifically was a winner.  The wine was half price since we went on a Thursday so it came down to under $20, a steal for the flavor! </p>

					<p>Poplar is located in an old house on the north edge of uptown.  It is owned by Charlotte architect, Lucia Zapata Griffith.  Walking around the space you can see it is decorated with paintings and stained glass.  By talking to staff we found out the paintings are from local artist Emily Andres. </p>

					<p>They also have a map where you can pin where you are from. Poplar is a beautiful space inside and out.  I canâ€™t wait to return and enjoy the patio. </p>

					<p>In addition to their normal menu, Poplar has wine dinners about once a month. </p>
