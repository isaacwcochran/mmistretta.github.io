					<p>When I first heard about the new wine bar in Plaza Midwood called The Bohemian I was thrilled! I felt like it was just what Plaza needed, a casual wine bar where I didn't need to take a loan out for a bottle of wine.  When we went in the other night with some friends it did not disappoint.</p>
					<p>Walking in the bar was full, but we were still able to get seats easily. The one wall was lined with bottles to browse, while there were tables and a bar on the other side. There also were a few comfy lounge areas.</p>
					<span class="image featured"><img src="/images/winebars/bohemian/tables.jpg" alt="wine-selection" /></span>
					<p>We picked up a bottle of Valpolicella Ripasso to split among the 4 of us.  When my husband mentioned wanting to get an Old World bottle under $30 there was a ton to choose from. The best part? No corkage fee.</p>

					<p>The Bohemian boasts a small food menu consisting of flatbreads, salads, and plenty of meat and cheese.  You can get a snack starting at just $4! While I personally recommend getting a bottle of wine since they start at just $15, you can find a glass of wine for just $6-7. </p>
					<p>The Bohemian is more laid back than your typical wine bar.  Patrick also filled us in on the background of The Bohemian and as he put it, <blockquote>We won't silently judge your wine selection because it doesn't perfectly pair with the cheese you ordered. And we won't roll our eyes when you mispronounce 'Cotes du Rhone.' ... Our GM, Harry, has the best palate in the building. He'll help you pick the perfect bottle. And Adam, our Kitchen Manager, is cranking out some killer stuff. He's responsible for those Godfather cheese and charcuterie boards everyone loves so much. I got the idea for the name in Cuzco, Peru at a coffee shop called 'La Bo'M.' I knew I wanted to do a wine bar and the bright, eclectic, warm atmosphere of La Bo'M really helped me solidify the vision for the space.</blockquote></p>
					<p>We highly recommend checking this place out ASAP!</p>
					<b>Location and hours:</b><br/> 
					213 North Trade St<br/>
					Matthews, NC 28105<br/>
					Sunday: 12PM-9PM | Monday - Tuesday: Closed | Wednesday-Thursday 3PM-10PM | Friday-Saturday: 12PM-11PM<br/><br/>
					<b>Pro Tip: </b> Bring a friend and get 2 glasses of wine for the price of 1 by splitting a bottle with NO CORKAGE FEE.  Ask Harry for help picking one out!<br/><br/>
					<b>Need to Know:</b>  The Bohemian never kicks people out if they're enjoying themselves after the posted closing time. If the place is packed on a Saturday at 11PM, they will stick around till everyone leaves.<br/><br/>
					<b>Patrick's Wine Selections:</b> "With temps still sitting in the 90s, I'd recommend a nice crisp, white like a Picpoul. Ours, the Picpoul de Pinet from La Domitienne, shows great minerality and acidity with subtle citrus notes. If you want to go with a red, try a Chateauneuf-du-Pape from the Rh√¥ne Valley. It's a beautiful, medium-bodied wine that exhibits stone fruits, honey, and spice."<br/>
