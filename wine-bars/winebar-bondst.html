					<p>Our go-to wine shop (The Wine Shop, in Dilworth) recently closed.  While we were sad to see it close, it opened up an opportunity for us to checkout Bond Street Wines.  We were very impressed! </p>

					<p>Before going we thought Bond Street was simple another wine shop.  Thankfully we went on a night that happened to have a tasting and we learned it was so much more.  A few different couples were hanging out at the bar and other tables sharing bottles of wine while having some pizza.  Other customers such as ourselves browsed the selection and enjoyed the tasting.  The tasting included 5 wines from a sparkling white to a Cabernet Sauvignon.  There was something for everyone to enjoy. </p>

					<p>Bond Street wines sets itself apart by its wine selection. They work with almost all distributors in the Charlotte area for a diverse selection that changes often. They have a boutique and European focus.  While the selection itself is killer, the staff is very knowledgeable about their wine as well.  If you know you like a certain wine, they will gladly help you find something new to try that you should like as well.  Cooking dinner and want something to pair with it? They have you covered.  Bond Street is a perfect shop for those looking to try something new, learn more about wine, or wine nerds who want that weird Slovakian wine they heard about or a pet-nat.</p>

					<p>If you want to sit and share a bottle at Bond Street there is no corkage fee.  They offer any of the bottles along the wines as well as several wines by the glass and beers by the can.  For food you are free to bring your own or try out some cheese they have available for purchase by Ormanâ€™s in 7th Street Market. </p>
