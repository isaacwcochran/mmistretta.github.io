					<p>We recently made our way in the newest location of the NY Butcher Shoppe in Dilworth, here in Charlotte.  Walking in, you immediately see all of the fresh meat to your right. From steaks to bone in pork shops and even crab cakes, the Butcher has everything you may need to cook a nice meal.</p>

					<span class="image featured"><img src="/images/winebars/ny-butcher/meat-closeup.jpg" alt="behind-the-bar" /></span>
					<p>In the middle, there are shelves with dry goods, and towards the left some fridges with to go snacks, cheese, and more.</p>
					<span class="image featured"><img src="/images/winebars/ny-butcher/pantry-items.jpg" alt="behind-the-bar" /></span>
					<p>The Butcher has staff with vast experience in the restaurant industry and provides many ready meals to take home. These meals are cooked in house in the same kitchen as the food available at the wine bar.  These meals can be found in the same fridges as the cheese. </p>

					<p>Moving towards the back of the space there is a vast selection of wine, appropriately a majority is geared towards pairing with steak. Finally, behind that is the wine bar area.  This is the first location of the NY Butcher Shoppe to have a wine bar as part of the location.</p>

					<p>We sat down at the bar and decided to get some truffle fries and a bottle of Orin Swift Abstract. The fries were some of the best I have ever had with an amazing aioli!  In addition, we had the chance to taste the philly cheesesteak, the scallops, and the hummus.</p>

					<span class="image featured"><img src="/images/winebars/ny-butcher/cheesesteak.jpg" alt="behind-the-bar" /></span>
					<p>We ended up enjoying our time so much we stayed longer than expected and also ordered a steak flight! The steak flight is exactly what you would image, like a wine flight, but with steak.  The selections are chosen by the chef and all 3 blew us away.  The food offerings range from $6 to $18 and glasses of wine start at $6.</p>
					<span class="image featured"><img src="/images/winebars/ny-butcher/steakflight.jpg" alt="behind-the-bar" /></span>
					<p>The Butcher also has a nice lounge area outside for when the weather is nice.</p>
					<span class="image featured"><img src="/images/winebars/ny-butcher/lounge.jpg" alt="behind-the-bar" /></span>
					<p>We highly recommend checking this place to grab a steak and bottle of wine for a nice night in or sit at the bar and make a Saturday of it by grabbing a snack and a drink!</p>
