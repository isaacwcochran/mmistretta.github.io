					<p>Note: This article was first posted on December 27, 2018 <a href="http://exploreclt.com/2018/12/27/you-had-me-at-merlot-wineclt-series-dilworth-tasting-room-more-than-a-wine-bar/">here</a></p>
					<p>Dilworth Tasting Room is much more than the wine bar you see at a first glance.  While they maintain the standard selection of California Cabernet Sauvignon, French Rhone Valley, and Italian varietals they offer much more unique wines as well.  Their selection is vast including wine from Croatia, Slovenia, and the NY Finger Lakes among others.  The tasting room includes a large selection of wines by the glass.  While I don’t usually find wines by the glass to be the best value, Dilworth Tasting Room has upped the ante and only offers wines by the glass that are exclusive to the wine bar for the time being making them much more appealing to those who would normally go for a bottle such as myself!  If you enjoy doing more of a wine tasting or flight Dilworth Tasting Room also offers that option.  Get a flight on Tuesday and get some free meat and cheese to pair with it! </p>

					<p>For our visit we went on a Thursday to take advantage of the half price bottles of Pinot Noir.  We had a bottle of Roco from the Willamette Valley.  It was delicious, smooth, but with complexity to hold up to our meal.  For food we opted for the burrata, the uptown flatbread, and the Tim panini.  All 3 lived up to our expectations and was a good combination to fill us up for dinner.  The burrata came with 2 seasonal spreads, eggplant and apricot this time of year.  The presentations and flavors were beautiful and complex.  Also on the menu was a nice selection of charcuterie, small snacks, and additional appetizers, flatbreads, and paninis. The menu rotates frequently changing about once a month.</p>

					<p>Aside from wine, Dilworth Tasting Room offers beer and cocktails.  The beer selection is a bit more diverse than other bars in the Charlotte area, with a focus on European styles. Don’t worry, you can still find a solid IPA though if that is more your vibe.  The cocktails use simple flavors and fresh ingredients for the best combination for lovely drinks. In addition, there a coffee and espresso machine making room caffeinated beverages with or without liquor. </p>

					<p>The decor of the wine bar is European in style.  There are two large red couches to lounge on, along with a large bar and tables. In addition, there is a beautiful patio area that is constantly full in the warmer months.  Whether you come for a date or to hang out with girl friends, the vibe will fit your needs. </p>

					<p>Talking to staff they all agreed that working at Dilworth Tasting Room was a great experience under the guidance of owner Jaffer Kovic.  In addition general manager Jacob Van Horn is very present at the wine bar ensuring guests are having a great experience and providing guidance on wine selections.  Kovic, Van Horn, and staff are welcoming and knowledgeable about the menu. From what food to pair with what wine, to crafting well balancing cocktails, Dilworth Tasting Room has a fantastic team. </p>
