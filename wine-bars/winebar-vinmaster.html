					<p>We came to Vin Master on a Thursday for one of their Mega Tastings.  These tastings happen once a month and for just $15 you can taste 20 or more wines.   The place was packed with people ready to taste. There were 5 different tables each with a different distributor and 4-5 wines at each.  Throughout the tastings, the groups of people were lively and friendly. Clearly, Vin Master is a place to have a good time. We enjoyed most of the wines we tasted and all were new to us except for 1 Italian rose. The selections were so good that we ended up purchasing a whole case of wine! The prices were also very reasonable.  Most of the bottles being poured ranged from $10-$25.</p>

					<p>It was crowded for the tasting, but after the tasting ended the space cleared out and got quieter.  We opted to stay and hang out for a bit over 1 more glass of wine. The glasses ranged in price from $9-13. They also have a selection of bottled and canned beer. </p>

					<p>After the tasting was cleaned up we could see the space is fairly open with a good amount of seating. In addition, there is patio seating where you walk in. The walls are covered with bottles of wine, giving the space a nice relaxed vibe. The design is very modern, but maintains a rustic feel.  Wines by the bottle can be taken home or enjoyed at Vin Master. It is a great place for a wine night with friends or a quiet date. Speaking with the staff, we learned many people also enjoy doing some work on their computers while there during the day.</p>

					<p>Vin Master has some limited meat and cheese options,  but no other food. Since they are located in Atherton Mill there are plenty of food options within walking distance.  We opted for O-Ku beforehand, but bringing food into Vin Master is welcomed. In addition, the location is right off of the light rail.  This allows for easy transportation from around Charlotte. Vin Master is also available for private events. Due to the convenient location, after leaving Vin Master, we were able to easily stop for ice cream at Jeni’s!</p>
