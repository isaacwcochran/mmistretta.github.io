					<p>Note: This article was first posted on August 15, 2018 <a href="http://exploreclt.com/2018/08/15/you-had-me-at-merlot-charlotte-wine-series-wine-vault-university-area/">here</a></p>
					<p>Walking into The Wine Vault you can see it has a distinctive feel different from your typical wine bars in Charlotte. The patio is casual and filled with people, while the inside has couches and art work displayed.  The atmosphere reminds me of a nice coffee shop inviting you to relax with friends or get some work done using the free WiFi.  There is plenty of space, making it great for groups. I came with my husband and 2 friends and there was plenty of options for seating. </p>
					<p>This place is made for wine snobs as well as those who just like to drink.  Wine bottles ranging from $20 up to $100+ fill the space with staff ready to help.   The price for beer is low at $4 for drafts.  Prices for a glass of wine vary a bit more from $7-11 and while there is no kitchen at the Wine Vault, it is surrounded by restaurants at the University Boardwalk (p.s. outside food can be brought in).  This wine bar is a great go-to place in the University Area for great wine and hanging out with friends!</p>
