					<p>Amateur Consumption was created to help you learn more about wine and tasting it.  I thought we could start off the blog with tips on tasting wine and the steps we will be following in every video. After pouring yourself a glass of whatever wine you fancy try these steps out for yourself. </p>
					<p><b>1. Swirl</b><br/>
						Once your wine is in your glass.  Check out the color.  Is it ruby red? Deep purple? Pink? Straw colored? Etc. This can be an indicator of what type of grapes are in the wine.  <br/>
						Next swirl the wine in your glass.  It can be useful to hold the glass on the table and move it around in small circles to successfully do this.  You may notice when the wine moves down the sides of the glass there are lines.  These are called legs. The legs of a wine indicate the alcohol content and texture of the wine.  In general the larger in size and number of legs the higher in alcohol content the wine is. 
					</p>
					<p><b>2. Smell</b><br/>
						Now that you are very familiar with what your wine looks like, take a sniff. Anyone can smell, but to ensure you get a really good wiff of your wine first swirl it and then immediately take your nose to the glass (or inside the glass ;-) ) and take a big sniff.  Do you get cherries or plums? Apricots or apples?  Soon you will recognize patterns in what you smell depending on the wine. 
					</p>
					<p><b>3. Sip</b><br/>
						Time for the important stuff.  The real point of wine is to drink it. Best to start with a small sip.  How do you like the taste?  That's the most important stuff.  From there try and think about what you taste.  Is it chocolate? Vanilla? Red Pepper? Honeysuckle? One nice trick to figure out alcohol content is how far back on your tongue and in your throat you feel a small burn.  The farther back, the higher alcohol content. 
					</p>
					<p><b>4. Summarize</b><br/>
						A nice way to summarize how you feel about wine is in 2 categories price and taste. We will use a few more in our reviews to try and determine how it appeals to our audience, but for personal use price and taste are the only two values you need to know.  Try rating the price out of 5 and the taste out of 5.  When you get something that adds up close to 10 you have a winner!
