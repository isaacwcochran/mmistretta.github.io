					<p>Note: This article was first posted on September 26, 2018 <a href="http://exploreclt.com/2018/09/26/you-had-me-at-merlot-wine-series-corkbuzz-a-master-sommeliers-wine-bar-southpark/">here</a></p>
					<p>Walking into Corkbuzz you can tell it is a bit higher end than the other wine bars I’ve written about so far. What you can’t tell from this first impression is how helpful and knowledgeable the staff are.  When I first heard about Corkbuzz and how it was opened by one of the very few female Master Sommeliers in the world, I knew I had to go.  We have been a few times, mainly to the cellar side, but this time we got the opportunity to sit down with the new beverage director and Advanced Sommelier Michael to learn more about Corkbuzz and the bar’s goals. </p>
					<p>Coming in we knew there were 2 spaces at Corkbuzz, the restaurant and the cellar.  Michael filled us in on both.  The cellar is aimed to be a casual space where people can go for happy hour after work and have a few snacks such as the $5 bar bites from 4pm-6pm everyday.  However, the full menu is also available in the cellar.  The cellar also is the main area for purchasing bottles at a retail cost to take home. The restaurant on the other hand is aimed to be a nicer meal out as a date or a girls’ night.  Having these 2 separate spaces allows Corkbuzz to have an atmosphere for whatever you are feeling that night.</p>
					<p>Michael feels like Corkbuzz stands out both in the wine and food selection as well as the training they give the staff.  I have been to many wine bars where I ask about a few wines and the staff has never tasted them.  This doesn’t happen at Corkbuzz. The staff are ready to answer questions, provide a taste when necessary, and help you find a wine you love.  In addition to training their staff, Corkbuzz also wants to help you learn more about wine.  They frequently offer wine classes on varying wine regions, grapes, food pairings, and more.</p>

					<p>After talking with Michael we settled in for dinner and attempted a blind tasting flight! The bartender provided us with a tasting sheet to take notes on and figure out what wines we were drinking.  We were given 2 reds and 1 white.  I won’t give too much away so that you can make your own attempts at blind tasting, but we ended up only getting one right.  It was a bit of a bummer for us since we have previously done better at blind tasting, but now there is just more reason to return.</p>
					<p>For dinner we went with the Brown Butter Cauliflower, the Risotto, and the Seasonal Tart.  We ended with the Lemon Box Dessert that came with coconut macaroons and pinot noir sorbet, suggested by Spencer who works mainly on the Cellar side of Corkbuzz. All the food was amazing! Corkbuzz really showcases an elevated menu that is fresh, simple, and a bit rustic.  Everything is made in house, from the ricotta in the risotto to the tart shell to the pinot noir sorbet.  The quality shines through and is designed to pair masterfully with the wine selection (which is does).  In addition, the menu is designed to be shared, allowing you to taste multiple dishes with friends.  Corkbuzz offers full glass pours as well as half glass pours, making it easy to have the exact wine you want with each part of your meal.</p>
