					<p>Wine bar and brewery you say? Sounds like the perfect spot for a birthday party. In this case, mine. Seaboard is perfect for hanging out with a diverse group of drinkers since they are a brewery with a wine room.  The prices are affordable with beers coming in at an average of $5-6 a pint and bottles of wine with prices as low as under $20.  We started with $6 glasses of rose before sharing a few bottles with friends. Non-wine drinking friends were able to get some delicious beer, include 24 beers on tap (8 of which are brewed by Seaboard).</p>
					<p>We munched on soft pretzels (7/10) and a charcuterie board (8/10), which comes with Orange Blossom honey, Lusty Monk mustard, Divina Fig jam, almonds and more! The goat cheese was by far the best part. For a more robust meal, go for a margherita or mushroom pizza from the Exchange Pizza Depot (housed in a small building beside the taproom). They offer 12″ Neapolitan style pizzas, featuring fresh and (if available) local ingredients!</p>

					<p>In addition to the drinks and food, there are corn hole boards set up outside.  While we sat inside since it was over 90 degrees the day we went, the patio at Seaboard is gorgeous and spacious.  Overall, Seaboard is the perfect place for winos (like me), beginners, or for those just wanting to have a drink.  They focus on smaller wine producers allowing to keep prices low and quality high.  No pretentious or intimidating attitudes about wine here.  It’s a great place to learn and try something new while having a great time. </p>
