					<p>Have you ever struggled to pair your food with a white wine?  Do you find some wines too dry, some too sweet, and struggle to find the perfect balance in one?  If so, Orvieto Classico is for you (and everyone else too ðŸ™‚ ).  Coming from Orvieto, just an hour or so north of Rome, Orvieto Classico is the white wine to please everyone.  It is perfectly balanced with acidity and juiciness.</p>
					<p>Although I am sure I had plenty of Orvieto Classico my first time in Italy, I distinctly remember when I had it in Orvieto itself.  I went with a group of students and a professor to Orvieto for a day trip.  After exploring the adorable little town and seeing the massive Cathedral, my professor took us to a restaurant hidden away down many ally ways.  It was the type of place with no menu.  You ate what the family in the kitchen was cooking that day.  My professor told us that Orvieto was known for their white wine.  I was thrilled!  My 18 year old self wasnâ€™t so sold on red wines yet (oh, how times have changed).  The wine was perfectly balanced and paired so well with the rustic italian food.</p>
					<p>WToday I am likely to pick up Orvieto Classico when I see it in a grocery store.  It runs close to $10 normally and is amazing for the price.  It pairs well with most food, but specifically is fantastic with seafood.  Itâ€™s bright and slightly acidic, but has the juiciness of a pear. Orvieto Classico is the white wine to please everyone.  Give it a try next time you are seeking some white wine!</p>
